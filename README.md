# Sample Contact app

![alt text](http://daveperez.io/gifs/contacts-app.gif)

My goal was to recreate Google's Contacts app as an educational exercise. Some features were purposefully left out because they weren't part of the scope of this project.

## Getting started

Make sure you `npm install` if you haven't already.

## Setting up the REST server

This app uses [json-server] to mock up a backend but will fallback to a localStorage solution. To start up the server, open a new terminal window, `cd` into the project, and run `npm run api`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.
