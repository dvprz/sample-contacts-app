# Sample Contact app

My goal was recreate to Google's Contacts app as an educational exercise. Some features were purposefully left out because they weren't part of the scope of this project.

## Getting started

Make sure you `npm install` if you haven't already.

## Setting up the REST server

This app uses [json-server] to mock up a backend but will fallback to a localStorage solution. To start up the server, open a new terminal window, `cd` into the project, and run `npm run api`.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
